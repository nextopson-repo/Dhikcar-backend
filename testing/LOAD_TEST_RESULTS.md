# Load Testing Results Summary

## Overview
Load testing was performed on the property creation endpoint (`/api/v1/property/create-update`) using the provided payload from `payload.json`. Two different load testing approaches were used to evaluate the server's performance under various load conditions.

## Test Configuration

### Endpoint Details
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5000/api/v1/property/create-update`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: application/json
- **Payload**: Property creation data with image keys, amenities, and specifications

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Custom Node.js Load Test
- **Total Requests**: 100
- **Concurrent Requests**: 10 per batch
- **Delay Between Batches**: 1000ms
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per request

#### 2. Artillery Load Test
- **Warm up phase**: 60 seconds, 10 requests/second
- **Sustained load phase**: 120 seconds, 20 requests/second  
- **Peak load phase**: 60 seconds, 50 requests/second
- **Cool down phase**: 30 seconds, 5 requests/second

## Results Summary

### Custom Node.js Load Test Results
```
‚úÖ Successful Requests: 97
‚ùå Failed Requests: 3
üìà Success Rate: 97.00%
‚è±Ô∏è  Total Time: 29174ms
üìä Average Response Time: 1847.81ms
‚ö° Min Response Time: 15ms
üêå Max Response Time: 2749ms
üìà Requests per Second: 3.43

üìã Status Code Distribution:
   201: 97 requests (Successful property creation)
   429: 3 requests (Rate limited)
```

### Artillery Load Test Results
```
Total Requests: 6,150
Failed Requests: 6,150 (100% rate limited)
Success Rate: 0%
Average Response Time: 1.3ms
Requests per Second: 12/sec
Status Codes: All 429 (Rate Limited)
```

## Key Findings

### 1. Rate Limiting
- The server has **rate limiting** enabled on the property creation endpoint
- During the custom test, 3% of requests were rate limited (429 status)
- During the Artillery test, 100% of requests were rate limited due to higher request rates

### 2. Performance Metrics
- **Successful requests**: Average response time of ~1.8 seconds
- **Rate limited requests**: Very fast response time (~15ms) as they're rejected early
- **Server capacity**: Can handle ~3.4 requests per second before hitting rate limits

### 3. Rate Limiting Configuration
The server appears to have rate limiting configured with:
- **Window**: Likely 1 minute
- **Limit**: Approximately 100-150 requests per window
- **Behavior**: Returns 429 status code when limit exceeded

## Recommendations

### 1. Rate Limiting Optimization
- **Review rate limiting settings** for the property creation endpoint
- **Consider different limits** for different user types (admin vs regular users)
- **Implement progressive rate limiting** (stricter limits for repeated failures)

### 2. Performance Improvements
- **Database optimization**: Response times of 1.8+ seconds suggest database bottlenecks
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- **Connection pooling**: Optimize database connection management
- **Image processing**: Consider async processing for image uploads

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Set up monitoring** for response times and error rates
- **Alert on high error rates** or response time degradation
- **Track rate limiting events** to understand usage patterns

### 4. Load Testing Strategy
- **Regular load testing** as part of CI/CD pipeline
- **Performance regression testing** before deployments
- **Stress testing** to find breaking points
- **Capacity planning** based on expected user growth

## Next Steps

1. **Analyze rate limiting configuration** in the server code
2. **Optimize database queries** for property creation
3. **Implement caching strategies** for better performance
4. **Set up continuous monitoring** for performance metrics
5. **Plan capacity scaling** based on expected load

## Conclusion

The load testing revealed that the property creation endpoint is functional but has rate limiting in place. The server can handle moderate loads successfully, but high concurrent requests are rate limited. The average response time of ~1.8 seconds for successful requests indicates room for performance optimization, particularly in database operations and image processing.

The rate limiting is working as intended to protect the server from abuse, but the configuration may need adjustment based on business requirements and expected user load.
