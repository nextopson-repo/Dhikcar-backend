# Bandwidth Testing Results Summary

## Overview
Bandwidth testing was performed on the property creation endpoint (`/api/v1/property/create-update`) to measure network performance, data transfer metrics, and bandwidth utilization. Both custom Node.js and Artillery approaches were used to evaluate network efficiency under various load conditions.
